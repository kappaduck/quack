# Quack! ðŸ¦†

Quack! is a fast, lightweight and user-friendly game engine built on [SDL] and its extensions ([SDL_image], [SDL_mixer], [SDL_ttf]). Designed for modern .NET 9+ applications, it provides a clean, flexible and intuitive API that simplifies game development by hiding low-level complexities. It uses SDL for 2D ([Renderer]) and 3D ([GPU]) rendering, window management, input handling and audio.
