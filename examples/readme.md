# How to use Quack! Engine

This document provides a overview of how to use the Quack! game engine by running or checking out various examples.
> You need to have .NET 10.0 SDK installed to run theses examples as [dotnet run app.cs].

To run a example, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet ./examples/windows/minimalWindow.cs
```

You can also open the example in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Rider, etc.).
> Any IDE doesn't support single-file execution, so you will need to run as cli.

> Visual Code have intellisense support for single-file but can't run it directly.
